#### Making Wood Work

Woodcraft is a 95 year old woodworking supply brand - a mid-sized retailer with more than 150 stores in the US and worldwide.  Additionally, they're a large provider of woodworking education through their bi-monthly periodical, Woodcraft Magazine, their enormous library of free online articles, and the abundance of classes and demonstrations offered by local stores.  They came to us looking to modernize their e-commerce platform, and to remodel their retail website with a fresh, elegant, and professional design that duly honors the artistry and craftsmanship of their clientele.

#### Learning the Trade

Because of Woodcraft's unique dual-focus on retail and education, we found that in addition to the usual tasks of building a low-friction and performant online shopping experience, we also needed to showcase their vast collection of articles, preferably in close proximity to related products.  After all, it's a lot easier to be confident and excited about a new project if you have a reliable how to guide, and readily-available links to all the tools and materials you need, all in one central place.  To achieve this end, we created numerous ways for merchandisers and marketers to display products, promotional banners, and articles almost anywhere.

#### Japan Woodworker

Immediately after Woodcraft's main storefront launched, I took over front-end leadership of the project, and the team and I were very quickly presented with a new challenge.  Woodcraft has a second brand - a high-end tool brand called Japan Woodworker, which they wanted to showcase with its own domain and its own design.  So, we spun off a second site, a re-skinned/themed version of the first.

At the time, multi-site theming was an untested concept on Weblinc's Rails platform, so there was a lot of learning to be done. But because we had had the foresight to build the first site with an eye towards variablizing as much of the front-end as possible, and because we had such great communication with our designer and clients, we were able to release the japan woodworker site within 6 weeks of woodcraft.com's release.

This was an enormous milestone for Weblinc as a company, as it prooved that once a client had undergone the lengthy process of having a new store built, we would be able to offer a large number of reskins for a company's other brands with a very fast turnover.  This gave our product a huge competitive advantage when it came to companies with a large number of smaller brands under their umbrella.
