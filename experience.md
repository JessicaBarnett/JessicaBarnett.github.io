Hello there!

Are you looking to add some tested technical prowess and creative finesse to your engineering team?

Need help from someone with a broad expanse of experience, but deep knowledge and expertice in the building of the front end of a web experience?

then you're at the right place!  welcome!


My name is Jessica, and I've been crafting web experiences since 2014.

Back then, React and Angular were still brand spankin new, flexbox and ES6 were exciting short on browser support, and the famously frustrating IE8 was still regretably relevant. (junior engineers:  you had no media queries?  seriously??)

Fast forward to today, and the world of front end engineering has evolved, evolved, and evolved some more.


I believe strongly in the value brought by experience.  Of knowing why things are the way they are, and how they got that way.


Greetings!
