It was an optimistic concept, envisioning a future of revolutionary progress in communication and technology, while simultaneously looking back on the giants of our past as a steady source of gratitude, guidance, and encouragement.</p>\n<p>His inspiring new idea quickly gained traction within the organization, and discussions of a reimagined company website began in short order.  I was approached with the opportunity to join the small, multi-departmental team which was assembling for this purpose, and was only too happy to join.  The team consisted of myself (front-end extraordinaire and cms wrangler), a tenacious and driven engineer from the DevOps team (AWS and CraftCms trailblazer), and our ambitious designer (the progenitor and committed shephard of the entire undertaking from beginning to end) from Marketing.</p>\n<p>This collaboration proved incredibly fruitful, as the three of us were each independently committed, congenial, communicative, and emminently capable.  The project was finished within a quarter, and the effort stood for some time as a prime example of what a few dedicated individuals can accomplish when given the leeway to imagine, experiment, and build something they&#39;re truly passionate about.</p>\n<SLIDER>\n\n<h4>Bringing Concept to Reality</h4>\n<p>When our project began, Relay&#39;s company site hadn&#39;t been touched in some time.  It was an inadequately documented and partially abandonned rails-based project, which was difficult to update content-wise, and was even more difficult to get running for development locally.  Ultimately our trio decided to start fresh with a brand new CMS (craftCMS), new database (postgres), new development process (docker), and a new build pipeline (aws), all of which made future releases and future development far easier than it had ever been before.</p>\n<p>Craft 3 was a reallly new product at the time, so we were among earliest adopters.  This presented a fair number of challenges, but their fantastic support helped a lot, and the overall ease of use of the end product made the effort worth it.</p>\n<p>The first hurdles we had to contend with were mostly related to getting cradft, postgres, docker and AWS to all play nicely together.  Credit to the heroic efforts of our Devops colleague, who truly pulled out all the stops to get the project through these initial roadblocks.</p>\n<p>After that, the issues became largely ones of unfamiliarity, as I&#39;d never worked with craft, and our designer, who had worked with craft, was new to writing code for the web.  The two of us had complementary strengths however, and we took every opportunity to share knowledge as we went.</p>\n<p>I introduced Sass and Twig to the project, to speed up development for both of us, and after some planning and aligning on things like git workflow, figma, project structure, and our the general plan of action, we got to work designing and building the layouts, content blocks, forms, and js features that would eventually be pieced together to create the finished product.</p>\n<h4>And on to the future!</h4>\n<p>The result of this collaboration was overwhelmingly positive, and offered a little something for everyone.</p>\n<p>Content editors were happy with the new set of  heavily-customized tools they now had, which offered all the flexibility they would need to build robust and eye-catching content far into the future, without having to involve the engineering department.  Engineering was happy that the project was well documented, so any future work wouldn&#39;t be tripped up before even getting the project running.  Our sales team was happy with the new tools we had included to help them source leads, based on site traffic and the interest form and handy product demo that was now directly and publicly available.  Marketing was happy with the fresh new visual language and style guide they now had at their disposal.  And the C-Suite and shareholders were happy with the new brand, and all of the excitement and positive energy that the new site was generating.</p>\n<p>I&#39;m quite proud to say that our tiny little project was able to provide so much good in the end.</p>\n"

Additionally, they&#39;re a large provider of woodworking education through their bi-monthly periodical, Woodcraft Magazine, their enormous library of free online articles, and the abundance of classes and demonstrations offered by local stores.  They came to us looking to modernize their e-commerce platform, and to remodel their retail website with a fresh, elegant, and professional design that duly honors the artistry and craftsmanship of their clientele.</p>\n<SLIDER>\n\n<h4>Learning the Trade</h4>\n<p>Because of Woodcraft&#39;s unique dual-focus on retail and education, we found that in addition to the usual tasks of building a low-friction and performant online shopping experience, we also needed to showcase their vast collection of articles, preferably in close proximity to related products.  After all, it&#39;s a lot easier to be confident and excited about a new project if you have a reliable how to guide, and readily-available links to all the tools and materials you need, all in one central place.  To achieve this end, we created numerous ways for merchandisers and marketers to display products, promotional banners, and articles almost anywhere.</p>\n<h4>Japan Woodworker</h4>\n<p>Immediately after Woodcraft&#39;s main storefront launched, I took over front-end leadership of the project, and the team and I were very quickly presented with a new challenge.  Woodcraft has a second brand - a high-end tool brand called Japan Woodworker, which they wanted to showcase with its own domain and its own design.  So, we spun off a second site, a re-skinned/themed version of the first.</p>\n<p>At the time, multi-site theming was an untested concept on Weblinc&#39;s Rails platform, so there was a lot of learning to be done. But because we had had the foresight to build the first site with an eye towards variablizing as much of the front-end as possible, and because we had such great communication with our designer and clients, we were able to release the japan woodworker site within 6 weeks of woodcraft.com&#39;s release.</p>\n<p>This was an enormous milestone for Weblinc as a company, as it prooved that once a client had undergone the lengthy process of having a new store built, we would be able to offer a large number of reskins for a company&#39;s other brands with a very fast turnover.  This gave our product a huge competitive advantage when it came to companies with a large number of smaller brands under their umbrella.</p>\n"
