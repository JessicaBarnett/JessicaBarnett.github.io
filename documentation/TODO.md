Now
- tweak sizing/positioning of everything (responsive)
- modify corner above projects - want it to translate in reverse sort of?  (but I do kinda like it how it is... )
- tweak footer rainbow (path c)
- rainbows are a bit off the edge on the right and bottom.
- reposition "vhs" elements (do this in css.  consider breakpoints)
- bg not blue lol
- clean up code?
- transitions?
- set a min-width on the page
- add some black space at the bottom to add to the vhs feel
- a lot of these fonts are weird at breakpoints.

Soon
- navigation
- form validation
- copy
- update links
- secrets?  how/where to host

- look at some other sites and see if I'm still happy with this?  is there anything else I want to add?

Later
- "more" tag to show more than 2 rows of tags on projects
- page stats box: componentize
- page stats box: hook up to github api
- "rewind"/back to top button
- scroll position on selectedFilter change when clicking on tags (it's janky)
- blog?
- animation
- add requestanimationframe
- re-enable click-tag-to-select-filter


Done
- make width/etc configurable like in the css version
- Add additional stripe colors to bgLines
