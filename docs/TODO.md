# In progress

NOTE FOR TOMORROW:
Working on *showing the mobile slides in the main slider on mobile only*
I'm thinking doing this by filtering slides out would be better, since it'll hide all the ui buttons for that slide as well (which just adding a class to the image does not).  That's probably what I'll do first thing tomorrow.

Also need to look at the mechanism controlling heights... it's stretching images weirdly and it cannot stand

Content Gen Script will be the next big task.
Then writing content and getting images
Then a real release!!


WIP
- (high priority) put mobile images in regular slider on mobile viewports to save space ***
- (high priority) storybook link is boken (deployment fix needed!!)
- (mid priority) content gen script
- (mid priority) content writing + image gathering

BUGS
- Fix weird button seam task would be a nice to have too (use clip-path)
- on filter select change, scroll jumps.  Should not.  fix me!
