## In Progress (Do before more-info page release!)
----------------------------------------------------------------

Things that FEEL urgent
- adjust drawer to change main content height instead of effing with the scroll pos?
-



- dark mode switch


rewind back-to-top

Content
- write actual content + get more pictures from the wayback machine

Drawer
  -  work on positioning of the back button on mobile - slide it off to the left and slide it back out on hover/tap
  - close on resize

Slider
  - arrows too big on mobile (and in general)
  - dots also too big (and hard to see)
  - title should have an opaque bg
  - expand button styling
  - on back, close dialog.
  - do some scroll/height fixing so you don't have someone scrolling down way below a shorter image

More Details page layout
  - use rainbow widths to define spacing of everything

Navigation Links
  - close drawer before going to id, when clicked



----------------------------------------------------------------
## Backlog
----------------------------------------------------------------
#### Top Priority!
- animate lines!
  - how to get the length of the lines?  that, and the height of the page, will determine how much of the line gets drawn per tick.

#### Testing/Audits
- browser testing
- Accessibility Audit
- mobile audit
- dark mode audit

#### Bugs
- figure out scroll jankiness on filter click
- tiled bg texture isn't as nicely tiled as it could be... **
- the more info page should reeeeally be a new route...


#### Features

- Css Modules / scoping
- "rewind" back to top button!
- animate lines **
- switch for dark mode
- more-info section **
- Articles/blog (link in social and in nav)

#### Storybook
- storybook doesn't actually trigger dark mode?
- align breakpoints in sb to breakpoints in project
- what knobs can I add to the stories?

#### Organization
- grid? other layout one-offs?  consolidation?
- standardize linter settings?
