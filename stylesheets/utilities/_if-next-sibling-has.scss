    We have a selector that can select based on the previous
    sibling's class...

    .make-the-next-p-different + p {
      // rules are applied to p tags that are
      // PRECEEDED by `.make-the-next-p-different`
    }

    but not one that can select based on the
    NEXT sibling's class.

    p - .make-the-previous-p-different {
      // this selector doesn't exist :(
    }

    this is just a slightly more readable way to do that.
