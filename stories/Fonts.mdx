<h1>Fonts</h1>

<p>There are 2 fonts available for use.  The primary font is called Inter, and is used for basically everything.  <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter" target="_blank">It came from google Fonts.</a>  I ended up with it sort-of by accident.  I did the first-pass design on an Ipad and used the apple default font (San Francisco), since it actually matched the VHS look pretty well.  But that font is proprietary, so I picked Inter instead, since it's the most similar free font I could find.</p>

  <div class="sb-example-block sb-inter">
    <h1>This is Inter!</h1>
    <h2>It's the primary font on this project</h2>
    <p>It's used for everything, honestly.</p>
  </div>

<p>The 2nd font is just for fun.  This design is based on a 90s blank vhs cover, and the <a href="https://fontsinuse.com/uses/3650/vhs-logo" target="_blank">historical font that was used for the "VHS" logo</a> is this one, `Lester Bold`.  It's a "very peculiar 1970s kind of typeface" created by one Leo Weisz for VGC. It was also used on the cover of Charlie's Angels in 1976.</p>

<Unstyled>
  <div class="sb-example-block sb-lester">
    <h1>This is Lester Bold! (the VHS logo font)</h1>
    <h2>It's a fun, thematically appropriate font</h2>
    <p>I actually haven't really figured out what I want to do with it yet.</p>
  </div>
