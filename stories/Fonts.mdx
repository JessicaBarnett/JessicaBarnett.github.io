<h1>Fonts</h1>

<p>There are 2 fonts available for use.  The primary font is called Inter, and is used for basically everything.</p>

<Unstyled>
  <div class="sb-example-block sb-inter">
    <h1>This is Inter!</h1>
    <h2>It's the primary font on this project</h2>
    <p>It's used for everything, honestly.  I chose it because I designed this on an Ipad and used the apple default font.  This was the most similar non-proprietary font I could find.</p>
  </div>

<p>The 2nd font is just for fun.  This design is based on a 90s blank vhs cover, and the (historical font that was used for the "VHS" logo)[https://fontsinuse.com/uses/3650/vhs-logo] is this one, `Lester Bold`.  It's a "a very peculiar 1970s kind of typeface" created by one Leo Weisz for VGC. It was also used on the cover of Charlie's Angels in 1976.</p>

<Unstyled>
  <div class="sb-example-block sb-lester">
    <h1>This is Lester Bold! (the VHS logo font)</h1>
    <h2>It's a fun, thematically appropriate font, used for buttons in some places.</h2>
  </div>
