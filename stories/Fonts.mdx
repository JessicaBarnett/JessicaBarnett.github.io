<h1>Fonts</h1>

<p>There are 2 fonts available for use.  The primary font is called Inter, and is used for basically everything.</p>

<Unstyled>
  <div class="example-block" class="inter">
    <h1>This is Inter!</h1>
    <h2>It's the primary font on this project</h2>
    <p>It's used for everything, honestly.  I chose it because I designed this on an Ipad and used the apple default font.  This was the most similar non-proprietary font I could find.</p>
  </div>
</Unstyled>

<p>The 2nd font is just for fun.  This design is based on a 90s blank vhs cover, and the historical font that was used for the "VHS" logo is this one, `Lester Bold`</p>

<Unstyled>
  <div class="example-block" class="lester">
    <h1>This is Lester Bold! (the VHS logo font)</h1>
    <h2>It's a fun, thematically appropriate font</h2>
    <p>I only used it on one button, but I kept it in there because I'm hoping I'll find another use for it soon.</p>
  </div>
