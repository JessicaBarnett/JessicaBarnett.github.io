# Projects

I find json files incredibly cumbersome to edit, so I made a little system that allows me to write copy + metadata for projects using yaml and markdown, and then run a script to convert it into Json.

## How to Add new Project

The process for editing the content for Projects is as follows:

### 1. Create a new markdown file in `/content/`

Copy the contents of the [`/content/template.md`](https://github.com/JessicaBarnett/JessicaBarnett.github.io/blob/main/content/template.md) file (shown below) into your new file.

### 2. Fill in the Yaml and Markdown

You can either fil it out for the list view only (omitting the optional fields) or for the full project details page.  plenty of examples in [`/content/*.md`](https://github.com/JessicaBarnett/JessicaBarnett.github.io/blob/main/content/)

Remember to put `<Slider>` somewhere in the markdown area, as a placeholder for where the mobile slider should be put in the markup.

### 3. Run the `genProjects` script

When you're done editing, run `npm run genProjects` from project root.  It will convert the yaml and markdown into a json object matching the `ProjectT` type (see [`./src/types/data-types`](https://github.com/JessicaBarnett/JessicaBarnett.github.io/blob/main/src/types/data-types.ts)), and put all the jsonified data in [`/data/projects.json`](https://github.com/JessicaBarnett/JessicaBarnett.github.io/blob/main/src/types/data-types.ts)(see below)
