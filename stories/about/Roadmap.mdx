# Roadmap

## In Progress

<div className="sb-data-list">
    <dl>
        <dt>Task</dt>
        <dd>Write Content for Project Detail Pages</dd>
        <dt>Type</dt>

        <dd>
            Now that the Project Page components are all out in the wild, I need more content to display with them!  That means collecting images (mostly from the wayback machine) and writing copy for each project in the list (eventually).  I'm planning to do the projects that have been public-facing first, as they're easier to source images for.

           To Do
           <div className='sb-ordered'>
            1. The Bouqs
            2. Relay Feed
            </div>

            Finished!
            <div className='sb-unordered'>
            - Woodcraft / JapanWoodworker
            - Relay Company Site

            I always do my best to follow best practices when it comes to accessibility, but I really do need to go in with a fine-tooth comb and make sure there's no issues.

        <dd>
            I know storybook has some nice visual testing tools that I can leverage.  And I also know there's a lot of js in this project that could use tests.  This must be rectified.

        <dd>
            The little trapezoid and triangle elements on the main page are currently made with pseudo elements that have a bg that matches the page bg.  But since both bgs are textured, they don't really blend that well.  If I made these shapes by applying layers of clip masks to the page instead, then the shapes wouldn't have a background - they would be transparent and the normal bg would show through.  I think this would be much cleaner visually.

            I have some dark mode styles in there already but have lost track of them.  I'm going to have to go through and audit everything to make sure it looks nice.

            I swear I spend as much time making the storybook look good as I do the rest of the website, and the custom css I've written for it is getting a little unweildy.  It might be time to organize it better and use sass, like I am with the main project.  There's really no reason not to.

            This is something I've been wanting to do since the beginning.  I wrote the canvas code in a specific way with a mind towards animating the lines "drawing themselves" as you scroll down the page.  It'll take some time, but I think the result will really make an impression!

            Since this is a vhs themed site, it's only fitting that the back to top button has the rewind symbol on it!  And at present there is no link that will take you back to the top, so this is technically something I ought to have anyway.

            This is a very experimental idea.  I've seen sites that have a color theme switch, where you can choose from a bunch of themes, and the whole page will change.  I just think it would be fun to write, as it would give me a chance to really see how far I can push css vars!

                1. select craftCMS tag (via select or tag)
                2. open the Relay Company Site Project Page

                5. repeat
                6. result: the craftCMS tag is still selected even though it's been deselected

            Github pages doesn't support BrowserRouter unfortunately, so despite React Router's assertion that using hash router isn't ideal, it's what I'll have to use if I want to continue using Github Pages (and I do).  This task will include:

                1. Main Navigation Links
                2. Project Page Back button
                3. Verify all transitions still work everywhere
                4. Verify anchor link behavior still works everywhere
