<h1>Colors</h1>

<h2>Available Colors</h2>

<p>These colors are all defined in `stylesheets/variables/_colors.scss`</p>

<Unstyled>
  <div class="example-block">
    { Object.keys(sharedVars.colors).map((colorName) => {
     return <div className={`color-block`} style={{backgroundColor: sharedVars.colors[colorName]}}><span>{colorName}</span></div>
    })}
  </div>
</Unstyled>

<h2>Colors in JS</h2>

<p>These colors are also available in Javascript.  This is necessary for the BGLines.ts file, which uses the same colors as the css does to draw background lines on the canvas.  (It also makes the documentation block in THIS file a lot easier to make, but that's not super important.)  </p>


<h2>Adding Colors</h2>

<p>To add a new color to both the JS and documentation:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Add the color variable as-per-usual to `stylesheets/variables/_colors.scss`</li>
  <li>run the `copyCssVars` npm script.</li>
  <li>verify the color appears in `src/css-variables.json`</li>
</ol>

<p>The copyCssVars script is a node script is located in `scripts/`.  It will parse all variables in `_colors.scss` (as well as `_breakpoints.scss`) and format them into a json file, which can be imported in any js files that need access.</p>

<h2>SVG Icon File Guidelines</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>filename should be kebab-case. The script will convert it to CamelCase when naming the component. (ex: `super-cool-cat.svg` will result in component `SuperCoolCatIcon.tsx`)</li>
    <li>use `viewBox="0 0 280 280"` to keep the new icon in line with the others</li>
    <li>There is no JSX conversion in this script, so you'll have to remove `xml:space="preserve"`, `class` properties, and anything else that isn't JSX-compatible</li>
    <li>remove any `fill` attributes if you want the icon to be recolorable!</li>
  </ul>
