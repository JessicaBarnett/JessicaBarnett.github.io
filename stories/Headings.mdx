<h1>Headings</h1>

<p>In most projects I've worked on in the past, there have been 2 sets of heading styles.  A "primary" and a "secondary", or similar.</p>
<p>This has always caused a dilemma for me.  Heading tags need to be used in a semantic and accessible way that follows the flow of the document, but this often conflicts with the visual treatment that's being asked for.</p>
<p>So, in this case, I chose to decouple my visual styles from the heading tags completely, so that any `<h*>` tag can be used by any of the visual-treatment classes available.  I've also chosen to divide my headings into 3 groups, with title, subtitle, and supertitle styles, to avoid confusing myself by using h1-6.</p>
