<h1>Design Process</h1>

<h2>Gathering Reference</h2>

<p>
  I began my redesign project by looking at other people's portfolios, to get a
  sense of what's out there, and what others think is important to highlight.
</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="https://fossheim.io/">Sarah L. Fossheim</a>: I wanted to focus more on typography in this build, so I was looking for portfolios that were reliant on words more than images. This Norwegian Developer's site certainly fits the bill, and is written by an accessibility expert as well!  I was endlessly entertained by the button animations here, as they feel almost like clicking a physical button, and I also liked the color scheme switches at the bottom.</li>

    <li><a href="https://brittanychiang.com/">Brittany Chiang</a>: A deceptively simplistic portfolio written by another accessibility-focused engineer.  I was mostly looking here to get a sense of what sort of content I'd want to include.  She has just 3 sections - about, experience, and projects.  She also has technologies tagged under each project/position and has links to her live projects.</li>

    <li><a href="https://droxey.com/">Dani Roxberry</a>: This Teacher/Engineer/Leader's portfolio has a design based on a physical object - a menu - which is something I really enjoy.  The typography and small design elements (boookmarks, stars, dotted lines) make it feel quite lighthearted.  Love it.</li>

    <li><a href="https://lynnandtonic.com/">Lynn Fisher</a>: This prolific designer/creator/speaker has a portfolio that is primarily focused on her giant library of really interesting, lighthearted projects, and secondarily on her writing and speaking.  It also has an archive of all portfolio's past designs, going all the way back to 2007.  It was quite fun seeing the evolution over the years.</li>

    <li><a href="http://findmatthew.com/">Matthew Williams</a>: This fellow redid his portfolio in the time that I was building mine, and it looks brilliant. The banner Animation is slick and appealing, and I was a big fan of the filterable projects cards.</li>

    <li><a href="https://www.filamentgroup.com/">The Filament Group</a>: This is another typography-focused website.  I spent a chunk of time digging into their css in console, looking to see how people do Emphasized text in Title and About Sections these days, and also looking to see how they do responsive text (rem units, naturally).</li>

    <li><a href="https://riccardozanutta.com/cerasa">Riccardo Zannuta</a>: This was a late addition to this list but I love how much movement there is in this!  I'm going to be adding motion to this project for super, so I'll be looking here for reference!</li>
</ul>

<p>
  From all these examples, I cherry picked a handful of elements I wanted to
  emulate.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>5 sections: Title, About, Projects, Resume/Experience, and Contact</li>
  <li>Projects should be tagged (and filterable) by technology</li>
  <li>
    I wanted to focus on typography first, and sprinkle little design elements
    here and there for levity
  </li>
  <li>I really liked the idea of having an animated title background</li>
  <li>Wasn't sure about adding a Skills section, but it was on the table</li>
</ul>

<p>
  But even with all that nailed down, I was still looking for some sort of
  visual inspiration. I tried looking for different sorts of animations I might
  use in a banner, and started to patch together a design from that. Scrapped
  it. I Also found some old advertisements for concerts that I liked visually,
  and I tried to make something out of that. Scrapped that as well.
</p>

<p>
  At some point, I found myself back on
  <a href="https://fossheim.io/"> Sarah Fossheim's portfolio</a>, looking at
  their codepen where they have some absolutely, mind-blowingly realistic
  <a href="https://codepen.io/collection/nwzQJq"> CSS drawings of Retro tech.</a>
  I figured I'd follow that interest and start looking for pictures of old retro
  technology and tech packaging - computers, calculators, phones, teletype
  machines, arcade cabinets, and the like.
</p>

<p>
  Like all good journeys, this winding road of discovery eventually led me right
  back home. Specifically, to my childhood home in the 90s, where I would fiddle
  with the VCR every night before school because I wanted to record the next
  day's episode of pokemon. Blank VHS tapes were ubiquitous in my house as a
  kid, and when I started coming across images of old blank-vhs packaging in my
  retro-tech adventure, the nostalgia hit me like a truck. And so did the simple
  designs, clean text, bright colors, bold lines, and the "futuristic" aesthetic
  that you see all over tech in the 80s and 90s. I loved it.

<p>
  This is the closest thing I have to a "final" Mockup. It was made in Procreate
  on an ipad.
</p>

<p>
  I've used Sketch, invision, Figma, and Illustrator/InDesign in the past, but I
  was a bit disheartened that all of these products follow subscription models
  now. I'm a bit unwilling to pay for any of these tools at the moment. I'm not
  aiming to create a pixel-perfect design. I have no Stakeholders or Executives
  to present this design to for sign-off, and I plan to do a lot of tweaking and
  designing in the browser console, so I'd actually prefer to work from a
  rougher sketch. Hence, I resolved to simply work with the tools I have
  available.
</p>

<p>
  Since this isn't a very large project, I've chosen to stick with a traditional
  single-page website. Most navigation will be handled through id anchors, and
  javascript to make it smoother and more modern.
</p>

<p>
  Content-wise, I've kept it simple, with a title, a small about section,
  filterable projects, a resume/experience section, and a contact form.
</p>

<p>
  Visually, I've incorporated several elements from the polaroid VHS packaging,
  including similar type treatments (especially the sparse capitalized text used
  for company names), black cut-outs on the sides (shaped like the cut-out one
  might use to get a tape out of its packaging), and the bold color-block
  stripes that flow down the length of the page and tie thewhole design
  together.
</p>

<h2 class="sb-clear">Cheers for the old Design</h2>

<p>
  Before venturing towards the portfolio of the future, we must bid farewell to
  the portfolio of the past.
</p>

<p>
  I liked it. I still do to be honest. It was started back when I was still in
  animation school and didn't have any idea how to make a website. I was using
  flash a lot, and it had some website tools, so I initially built this design
  using that. I had a little loop with sparkling stars, and flowing fireflies
  drifting around the lantern, and a subtle motion through the leaves in the
  foreground. And I'd had some cool parallax scrolling happening, and pngs with
  transparent bits so it looked like the content was peeking through a lattice.
</p>

<p>
  It was neat. Very much an art student project. It will be remembered with
  fondness.
</p>

  alt="Home page from 2014. The Title text says 'Jessica Barnett, Front end developer', and the navigation lists 'top', 'about', 'projects', 'skills' and 'contact'. In the foreground is the black silhouette of 2 tree boughson either side, and a lit lantern in the center-left.  In the background is a faded mountain range and a starry, dark blue sky."
